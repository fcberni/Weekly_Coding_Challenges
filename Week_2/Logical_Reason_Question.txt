What day is the fourteenth of a given month?

Each Question given below has a problem and three statements numbered I,II and III giving certain information. You have to decide if the information given in the statements is sufficient for answering the problem. Remember out of the three statements, each of them alone can also be sufficient to answer the question. In such cases for example, your answer should be taken as Only I or Only II or Only III and not Only I.

I. The last day of the month is a Wednesday.

II. The third Saturday of the month was seventeenth.


(a) if the data in statement I alone are sufficient to answer the question;

(b) if the data in statement II alone are sufficient to answer the question;

(c) if the data either in I or II alone are sufficient to answer the question;

(d) if the data even in both the statements together are not sufficient to answer the question;

(e) if the data in both the statements together are needed;

---------

The answer is b since statement II alone is sufficient to answer the question. You can simply count backwards from that Saturday the 17th until you reach the day that lands on the 14th.

Saturday 17
Friday 16
Thursday 15
Wednesday 14

The information in statement I is not necessary.
